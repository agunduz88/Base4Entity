# Base4Entity
A Search and CRUD Framework with a lot of nice features that works with Entity Framework

What is Base4Entity? 

Base4 Entity is a winforms Search & CRUD framework that works with entity framework.

I have used & override metroframework controls because I just loved the visuals:) 
you could however use the original winforms by inheriting the base4controls however you will need to customize textbox with button that comes with metroframework. 

P.S thanks to
