What is Base4Entity? 

Base4 Entity is a winforms Search & CRUD framework that works with entity framework.
-Works fast
-Very easy to use
-Will save you a lot of time 
-Code less


I have used & override metroframework controls because I just loved the visuals:) 
you could however use the original winforms by inheriting the base4controls however you will need to customize textbox with button that comes with metroframework. 

Setup: Import the following .dll files into your program

- Base4Controls.dll
- Base4Entity.dll
- MetroFramework.Design.dll
- MetroFramework.Fonts.dll
